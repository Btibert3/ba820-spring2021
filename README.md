# BA820: Unsupervised Machine Learning and Text Analytics

This repo contains the materials for a course in unsupervised machine learning and text analytics with python.  Students should plan to close this repo and pull the most recent changes before each class meeting.

This class still uses Questrom Tools for the following:

- The private Zoom Link for our class streams
- Assignment submission and exams
- Q&A via the forums
- Annoucements


## Schedule

Each class session is as follows (Boston-local time):

1. Cohort A from 9:25-10:40 in Room 306 + Zoom
2. Cohort B from 10:55-12:10 in Room 212 + Zoom

The afternoon and evening session are open to both cohorts:

1. Afternoon Session = 2:30-3:45 in Room 208 + Zoom
2. Evening Session = 7:45-9:00 on Zoom only

> NOTE: I reserve the right to modify the syllabus at any time at my discretion.


## Requirements

- BU-associated Google account
- Google Cloud Account setup and any appropriate projects created (The syllabus has a code for $50 of GCP credits for this course)
- A python coding environment where you are able to install packages.  This could be Colab or local coding.

## Setup

- We will be using Big Query for our datasets this semester.  For ease-of-use, you may want to pin the dataset (i.e. database) that will have the tables for our work.  The dataset/tables are available via `questrom.datasets`.  __PRIOR TO CLASS__ you should have tested that you can access the tables.  For example, count the number of records in the diamonds table.
