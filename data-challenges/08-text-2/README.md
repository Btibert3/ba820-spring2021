# Data Challenge

Cluster documents based on their text.  We will ignore the label of the topic intentionally as a way to evaluate the cluster solutions.

## Dataset:

- Big Query via `questrom:datasets.topics`


## Considerations

- tokenization
- stop words or custom stop words?
- Dimensionality reduction?
- Token weights?
- Cluster approach given above pre-processing?
